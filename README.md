# Course-Notes

Given that I will be taking a wide range of courses during my time at University of Waterloo, I think it would be a good idea to compile all the typed course notes (either typed up by me, another student, or the profs themselves), especially for upper year classes, in order to provide the necessary resources for anyone who might consider taking these in the future.
